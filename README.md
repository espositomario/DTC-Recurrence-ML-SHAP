# Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (DTC) Recurrence Prediction and SHAP Analysis


**Authors**: [Irene D'Onofrio](https://github.com/irenedonofrio) and [Mario Esposito](https://github.com/espositomario)

**Aim**: This project provides a robust benchmarking of machine learning models for predicting differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) recurrence, using nested cross-validation (nCV) for evaluation and SHAP analysis for interpretation.

**Methods**: Models tested included Support Vector Machine, XGBoost, Random Forest, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Multi-Layer Perceptron, evaluated using a stratified 5-fold outer nCV with a 3-fold inner loop for hyperparameter tuning. SHAP analysis was applied to the best-performing model (SVM) to assess feature importance and explain predictions.

**Results**: SVM, XGBoost, and RF showed the strongest generalization, with SVM achieving the highest average MCC of 0.91 Â± 0.04. SHAP analysis identified "Response" as the most influential feature (followed by others), and provided insight into misclassified cases.
